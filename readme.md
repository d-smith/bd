A couple simple examples using Blockdaemon/Sepior MPC to generate a key, show the EOA associated with the key,
get the EOA balance, and send ETH from the EOA to another address.

This code cribs from the Sepior examples. To run it you'll need access to a Sepior environment...

The take away from this code is Sepior abstracts away the complexities of MPC TSS to present a simple to use
key management and signing capability provided via MPC TSS.
